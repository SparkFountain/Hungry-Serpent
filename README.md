## What's this?
You move a green snake over the screen and navigate it to the red apples.
Every time the snake gulps an apple, it grows a bit and moves faster.
After some time, massive gray rocks will appear which you have to avoid.
If the snake hits a border or rock or bites itself, the game is over.

**Hungry Serpent** is just a very basic
[Snake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_%28video_game%29)-Clone with simple, 
computer generated graphics. The game does not use any external ressources.

## Controls
Move the Snake with the `arrow keys`. Try to head for the apples (these are the red circles)
whereas you should sidestep the rocks (the gray circles).

If you lose, the game will restart.

## Language Configuration
The ingame texts are available in English, as well as in German. Press `D` to get
the German interface and `E` to switch back to English language.

## Credits
* Programming: Stefan Behrendt

This game is written in [Blitz3D](http://www.blitzbasic.com/Products/blitz3d.php)
and the source code is attached. It is commented so that you can see how the game
logic works at all. Hence, you can also use this as a *tutorial* if you feel like
programming a snake clone on your own.

The coding style is very strict: That means all local variables have been explicitly
initialised and the data types are indicated consistently. The code follows the 
**SparkBlitzSyntax** rules.
